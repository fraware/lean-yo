*Transform complex category theory proofs into elegant, readable solutions*

</div>

## Overview

**LeanYo** revolutionizes category theory proof development in Lean 4 by providing powerful tactics that leverage the fundamental (co)Yoneda isomorphisms. Whether you're working with functors, natural transformations, or complex categorical diagrams, LeanYo makes your proofs more intuitive and maintainable.

### Key Features

- **`yo` Tactic**: Transforms morphism goals into pointwise goals using (co)Yoneda isomorphisms
- **`naturality!` Tactic**: Automatically closes standard naturality squares and whiskering equations
- **Safe & Robust**: Minimal configuration with safe defaults and robust performance on large diagrams
- **Readable**: Provides clear explanations and debug information
- **Configurable**: Flexible options for different use cases and performance requirements

### Library Architecture

LeanYo is built with a modular architecture that separates concerns and provides clean interfaces:

## Installation

Add LeanYo to your project by including it in your `lakefile.lean`:

```lean
require lean-yo from git "https://github.com/fraware/lean-yo.git"
```

Then import the library in your Lean files:

```lean
import LeanYo
```

## Usage

### Basic Tactics

#### The `yo` Tactic
Transform complex morphism goals into simpler pointwise goals:

```lean
import LeanYo

-- Before: Complex morphism goal
example {C D : Type} [Category C] [Category D] (F : C ‚•§ D) (X : C) :
  F.map (ùüô X) = ùüô (F.obj X) := by
  yo  -- One tactic solves it!

-- The yo tactic transforms this into a pointwise goal that's much easier to prove
```

#### The `naturality!` Tactic
Automatically solve naturality squares and whiskering equations:

```lean
-- Before: Manual naturality proof
example {C D : Type} [Category C] [Category D] (F G : C ‚•§ D) (Œ∑ : F ‚ü∂ G) (X Y : C) (f : X ‚ü∂ Y) :
  Œ∑.app X ‚â´ G.map f = F.map f ‚â´ Œ∑.app Y := by
  naturality!  -- Automatic solution!
```

### Debug Tactics

Get detailed information about what the tactics are doing:

```lean
-- Print the exact rewrites used by yo
yo?  -- Shows you exactly how yo transforms your goal

-- Print the exact rewrites used by naturality!
naturality?  -- Reveals the naturality steps taken
```

### Working with Hypotheses

Apply tactics to specific hypotheses:

```lean
-- Apply yo to a hypothesis
yo at h  -- Transform hypothesis h using Yoneda

-- Apply naturality! to a hypothesis  
naturality! at h  -- Apply naturality reasoning to h
```

### Configuration

Customize tactic behavior for your specific needs:

```lean
-- Set Yoneda direction
yo.direction := covariant    -- Force covariant direction
yo.direction := contravariant  -- Force contravariant direction
yo.direction := auto         -- Let the tactic decide (default)

-- Set naturality! performance options
naturality.maxSteps := 64    -- Maximum rewrite steps (default: 64)
naturality.timeout := 1500ms -- Timeout per call (default: 1500ms)
```

## Attributes

### @[naturality]

Register your natural transformation lemmas to make them available to `naturality!`:

```lean
@[naturality]
theorem my_naturality_lemma {C D : Type} [Category C] [Category D] 
  (F G : C ‚•§ D) (Œ∑ : F ‚ü∂ G) (X Y : C) (f : X ‚ü∂ Y) :
  Œ∑.app X ‚â´ G.map f = F.map f ‚â´ Œ∑.app Y := by
  -- Your proof here - now naturality! can use this lemma!
```

### @[yo.fuse]

Register fusion lemmas that combine `map_comp`, whisker laws, and functoriality:

```lean
@[yo.fuse]
theorem my_fusion_lemma {C D : Type} [Category C] [Category D] 
  (F : C ‚•§ D) (X Y Z : C) (f : X ‚ü∂ Y) (g : Y ‚ü∂ Z) :
  F.map (f ‚â´ g) = F.map f ‚â´ F.map g := by
  -- Your proof here - now yo can use this for fusion!
```

## When to Use Which Tactic

### Use `yo` when:
- You have morphism goals involving functor maps
- You want to transform goals using Yoneda isomorphisms  
- You're working with `Category.comp` chains with functor maps
- You need to simplify complex categorical expressions

### Use `naturality!` when:
- You have naturality square goals
- You're working with natural transformations
- You have goals of the form `Œ∑.app _ ‚â´ _ = _ ‚â´ Œ∑.app _`
- You need to prove whiskering equations

## Common Pitfalls

| Issue | Solution | Prevention |
|-------|----------|------------|
| **Over-rewriting** | The tactics are designed to be safe, but be aware of potential infinite loops | Use debug tactics (`yo?`, `naturality?`) to understand what's happening |
| **Direction confusion** | Use `yo.direction := auto` to let the tactic decide the direction | Start with `auto` and only specify direction when needed |
| **Timeout issues** | Increase `naturality.timeout` for complex diagrams | Monitor performance and adjust timeout as needed |

## Performance

LeanYo is designed for high performance with the following guarantees:

| Metric | Target | Description |
|--------|--------|-------------|
| **P50** | ‚â§ 80ms | Median response time on P0/P1 test suites |
| **P95** | ‚â§ 400ms | 95th percentile response time |
| **Efficiency** | ‚â•60% reduction | Reduction in manual proof steps on large diagrams |

### Performance Tips

- Use `yo.direction := auto` for optimal performance
- Increase `naturality.timeout` only when necessary
- Register custom lemmas with `@[naturality]` and `@[yo.fuse]` attributes
